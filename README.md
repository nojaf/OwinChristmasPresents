Owin Christmas presents
=====================

This is basic Owin and Katana example website.

Static files from the `public` folder are served and all others are blocked.

The front exists of a small **angularjs** app made in **TypeScript**.
The goal of that app is to add a list of persons and arrange who should buy a present for who.

The app will be published on Azure.

Web Api is enabled for academic purposes. The logic in the ApiController could have been done on the client.
